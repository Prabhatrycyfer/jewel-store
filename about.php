          <h2>FOUNDER</h2>
          <p>A chance foray into designing jewelry for one of her mother-in-law's clients way back in 2010, led Prerna from the financial world of the global consulting firms to the eternal exquisite and hallowed portals of exceptional designing and craftsmanship. Her eye for detailing and the creative challenge and opportunity to work at the source with the karigars helped her plunge full time to design masterpieces that celebrate the beauty in woman in particular and life in general.</p>

          <p>Notwithstanding the challenges of leaving behind her Chartered Accountancy and her American CPA degrees, she conceptualized the brand, A-JEWELS (meaning 'eternal' in Sanskrit), while still living in New York with the passion and the vision of bringing couture jewelry to Indian women at affordable rates.</p>

          <p>With the prestigious accreditation of jewellery analyst from GIA, Prerna Rajpal's penchant for style and a keen eye for detail makes for jewellery that is unparalleled in its contemporary flair. She hones her inspiration from India's rich culture, vibrant hues, intricacies of nature and the legacy of the royal heritage.</p>

          <p>Prerna's brand philosophy is to craft pieces that are not only aspirational and glamorous but also reflective of the client's individualistic fashion statement. Her target customer is someone with a strong sense of fashion and style, who knows what will work for her and is not afraid of trying bold, singular pieces. It could be anyone from an experienced, daring red carpet habitué or an upwardly mobile professional woman who is not scared of making a bold statement.</p>

The warmth of her presence and her experienced consultation skills brings women through the door that convert to lifelong patrons.</p>
        <p>Today, Prerna is recognized by fashion magazines (Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Brides Today, Femina, Verve) as one of India's most exciting jewelry designers. In a short span of time, she has garnered a client base of over 1000 loyal customers with her exceptional designs spanning across markets of NCR, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad to International hotspots like Dubai, New York and Singapore.
