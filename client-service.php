        <p>We truly believe we make some of the most exquisite handcrafted jewels which are a result of intense labor of love and our unique design sensibilities and we would love to back them up with a life-long guarantee. To ease your online buying experience and to remove all anxiety from the process, we offer a 100% buy back and exchange guarantee. So if you don’t have a positive experience for ANY REASON and our customer service team is not able to set it right for you, or the jewels do not match your expectations, an exchange or a return can be initiated anytime by calling our Customer Service at +91 9560017853, +91-9999677653 between 11 am - 7 pm IST, Monday - Saturday or by emailing us at online@a-jewelsjewels.com, and we will take the responsibility to make it right.</p>

        <p> <strong>EXCHANGE – </strong> We understand that sometimes you may not find your ideal jewel in one-go. Hence, A-JEWELS offers a zero-deduction first exchange to make it right for you. The exchange request must be initiated within 7 days of receipt of product for a zero-deduction exchange along with the code of the product you want it be exchanged with. The jewel to be exchanged should be in the same condition as it was purchased. If we receive an exchange request for a jewel that has been used or damaged or the security tag has been tampered with, we will not be able to offer a zero-deduction exchange. You can then request to have it shipped back at your expense. For an exchange after a period of 7 days, a restocking fee of 10% of the order value will be levied on the exchange of diamond jewellery and 20% of the order value will be levied on the exchange on uncut diamond or polki jewellery. This option is available for the life-time of the jewel purchased. A complimentary pick up of your jewel will be arranged by us within 48 working hours of receiving your request. Our customer service team would proactively reach out to settle any incremental/reduced purchase value. </p>

        <p> <strong>REFUND PROCESS – </strong> Once the jewel has been picked up by the courier team, kindly allow us up to 20-25 business days to credit the amount back in your account. </p>

        <p> Business days are Monday-Friday except for national holidays. Return and exchange processing begins after your package is delivered to us. For any inquiries concerning returns or exchanges, please contact Customer Service via email at online@a-jewelsjewels.com or by phone at +91 9560017853, +91-9999677653 between 11 am - 7 pm IST, Monday- Saturday. </p>

          <p> For <strong>In-store returns and exchanges, </strong> bring your invoice or receipt (required) to our flagship store during our store operational hours 11AM – 7PM (Monday to Saturday). </p>

          <p> <strong>DISCLAIMER – </strong> Due to increased volume of orders and a smaller team, you may experience a longer waiting period to receive your order. We appreciate your patience and hope to deliver sparkles and love at the earliest.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Don’t wear your A-JEWELS to bed as it is the number 1 cause of losing gemstones and wearing out 
                  of prongs.</li>
                  <li>A simple polishing cloth can do wonders - Microfiber polishing cloth, similar to the one you use to clean your sunglasses, is an alternative to aggressive cleansing methods.</li>
                  <li>The best solution to keep your on-the-go diamond jewels without any precious stones is to use soap and water and gently brush your pieces with a soft toothbrush. CAUTION - This method cannot be used for polki jewelry and diamond jewelry studded with precious stones or pearls.</li>
                  <li>Always keep in mind that your jewels must be the last thing you put on while dressing up, keep them away from any contact with perfumes, chemicals or body lotions.</li>
                  <li>Schedule a 6- monthly check up for your jewels to keep all your jewelry woes at bay.</li>
                  <li>All your jewels must be stored in separate boxes, specially your polki (Uncut diamonds)</li>
                  <li>You must always keep your polki (Uncut diamond) jewels away from any kind of contact from water.</li>
                </ul>
